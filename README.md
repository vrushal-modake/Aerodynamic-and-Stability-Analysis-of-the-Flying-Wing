# 🛩️ Aerodynamic and Stability Analysis of the Flying Wing  
### Effect of Elevon Trim and Winglet Cant Angle Variation

This repository presents the design, simulation, and analysis of a **tailless flying wing aircraft** with variable **winglet cant angles**. The project investigates how different winglet configurations and elevon trimming influence aerodynamic efficiency, flight stability, and control authority in UAV designs.

## 📖 Project Overview

- **Goal**: Optimize flying wing performance by studying the effect of winglet cant angles and elevon trim on aerodynamic stability.  
- **Cant Angles Tested**: 5°, 30°, 60°, 90°  
- **Methodology**:  
  - Aerodynamic analysis using **CFD** simulations  
  - Stability evaluation of **longitudinal and lateral modes**  
  - Trim condition adjustments via **elevon deflection**  
  - Root locus analysis for stability verification

## ✈️ Key Findings

- Lower cant angles (**5° & 30°**) → Higher aerodynamic efficiency with max **L/D = 18.3** but reduced lateral stability.  
- Higher cant angles (**60° & 90°**) → Stronger **Dutch roll and spiral damping**, but with higher drag.  
- **Elevon trimming** restored trim across all angles and stabilized Dutch roll at low cant angles.  
- Spiral mode instability persisted at **5°**, highlighting geometry-driven limits.  
- Longitudinal stability (short-period & phugoid) remained robust in all cases.
